Kubernetes affinity and anti-affinity

Kubernetes labels provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and managing resources. By assigning descriptive key-value pairs to pods and other objects, we can effectively 
categorize and filter them, enhancing operational efficiency. This granular control facilitates streamlined development and maintenance processes. Furthermore, labels serve as 
essential identifiers for controllers and services to accurately target and manage their associated resources. Leveraging labels for querying, deletion, and other management 
tasks significantly improves overall resource administration.

Kubernetes labels offer a multi-dimensional approach to resource management. By applying labels across various attributes such as application type (e.g., app: myapp), deployment
tier (e.g., tier: frontend), environment (e.g., environment: dev), and version, we can effectively categorize and organize resources. This granular labeling scheme facilitates
efficient management and querying operations.

labels:
  app: myapp
  tier: frontend
